in this billing engine, user act as a borrower 

create a billing engine with purpose of:
1. Loan Schedule: get when and how much user have to pay
2. Outstanding Amount: get how much user have to pay
3. Delinquent Status: get status which is user delinquent or not

This is basic requirement of borrowing a money:
1. user can borrow money total of a Rp5.000.000 
2. with tenor of 50 weeks (around 1 year) 
3. got a flat interest of 10% per years (around 0,2% per month)

every week system will scheduler how much  each user have to pay. 
w1: 110.000
w2: 110.000
...
w50: 110.000

when user want repay their loan, user have 2 option:
1. to pay exact number. cannot be less or more than billed
2. not pay whatever is billed

every time user repay their loan, system have to calculate outstanding amount. from Rp5.500.000 until Rp0

when user miss 2 weeks of their repayment, then user will tag as delinquent user.

when user miss some of their repayment, then user have to repay sum of missed amount. ie, if user miss 2 weeks, then user have to pay amount_due for 2 weeks

method need to be implemented:
1. GetOutstanding: return outstanding amount of specific user_id or loan_id 
2. IsDelinquent: return delinquent status of specific user_id
3. MakePayment: create a record of user repay their loan
